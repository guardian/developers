                            <h2 id="engineering-team-culture">Engineering Team Culture</h2>
<p><strong>Delivery Mindset —</strong> We believe in being pragmatic and moving fast, spending our energy on the right things, shipping code and then rapidly iterating on it.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviours:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We simplify our work, focusing on getting it to the user as early as possible.</li>
<li>We don’t wait for decisions to be made for us, we are an empowered engineering function and you are an empowered engineer. We own the problem, not the spec.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inclusiveness &amp; Respect —</strong> We believe that our culture is important, and we all contribute to it regardless of our role or level.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviours:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>We ensure to treat everyone we encounter with respect independently of their skill sets and levels of ability  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Every one of us has multiple interactions with a variety of people across the department and company every day. Each one of those is an opportunity to express and refine our culture. This written statement of our culture is shared, and anyone can <a href="https://github.com/guardian/our-engineering-culture/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribute</a>.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>We respect the opinion of others and are gracious in our interactions, whether meeting physically or digitally, whether friend or stranger, whether employee, customer or commenter.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>We come from different backgrounds, work in different roles, are different ages, and therefore have different levels of experience. All in all, we pull each other up, not bring each other down.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Working as a team —</strong> We believe that the team is everything and our lowest common unit, set up with the necessary skills to succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviours:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We fail and succeed together as a team.</li>
<li>We are independent, accountable and share responsibility. We conduct ourselves with humility, kindness and a calm manner. We debate ideas, not people and we share constructive feedback openly.</li>
<li>We take the time needed to listen to and help our colleagues with any problem they might have from anywhere within the business.</li>
<li>We value the experience of people in the team and the different constraints within their lives.  </li>
<li>We celebrate success and positive behaviour, recognising everyone’s contribution while treating every moment including tasks and failures as a learning opportunity.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We are data driven —</strong> We believe that to be responsible in our impact we must be led by data.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviours:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We base decisions on analytics and experiments to reach consensus having heard everyone’s voice.</li>
<li>We measure our success through data analysis and not through the highest paid person&#39;s opinion or the loudest voice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Empowerment —</strong> We believe that all of us want to - and can - make a difference to the Guardian.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviours:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We choose to work here because we believe in what the Guardian stands for. We&#39;re excited at contributing to the Guardian&#39;s future.</li>
<li>Meeting the needs of people we encounter across the Guardian is consistently encouraged across all levels of engineering.</li>
<li>We trust engineers to build the right things, collaborating closely and transparently with other teams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Excellence —</strong> We believe that embracing technical innovation and excellence can help us make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviours:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We can better achieve the Guardian&#39;s objectives by having a deep understanding of the technology we use and adopting emerging tools and solutions before others.  </li>
<li>We maintain our technical advantage through continuous innovation</li>
<li>We aim to be at the forefront of tech, staying curious, looking to innovate and continuously improve.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Knowledge sharing —</strong> We believe that it’s our responsibility to upskill one another, sharing our knowledge, learnings and mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviours:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals are entitled to pairing time for their development.</li>
<li>We make time for individual-learning &amp; career development with personal development being our priority.</li>
<li>We write code for the most junior, not the most senior.</li>
<li>We actively share at all levels of users and stakeholders, whether it&#39;s our knowledge, work, planning or approach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We care —</strong> We are not driven to simply deliver the implementation of a specification, but delight in working collaboratively to achieve an objective. In return, we are enthused to do whatever we can to deliver value to the Guardian.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviours:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We seek to be an influential voice in the way things are done in the business and by other teams and departments</li>
</ul>
